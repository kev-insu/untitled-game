2024.4.29:
    - balanced prestige layer's reset (rarity - 7) as well as rebirth upgrade 2


2024.4.28:
    - layer 2 (prestige) added
    - layer 1 (rebirth) added
    - buttons 1 and 2 have functions and work now (reset for rebirths and luck upgrade)
    - added button animations, although basic
    - added a gameLoop to constantly update values by tick (hopefully working as intended)
    - proper preparation for implementation of upgrades
        - roll button can be dynamically altered in speed with upgrades
        - introduced rebirth, prestige, and transcension layers with proper gradients above rarity text
            - true and base mechanics do not work yet, but the text formats are there
    - created a gradient and properly aligned "stats" above rarity
    - imported break_eternity script (credits to Patashu)
        - have yet to understand its usage though
    - oriented rarity at bottom right
    - prevented potential future overflow in the x and y axes

2024.4.27:
    - (WIP) usage of break_eternity script for true incremental scaling
        - break_eternity script supports numbers up to 10^^1e308
    - accounted for proper luck scaling towards rarities
    - implemented the barebones mechanic for rolling rarities (hover/ click buttons)
    - implemented background and font
    - created icon

2024.4.26:
